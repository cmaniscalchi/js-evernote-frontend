make a plan, break it down into steps, do them in order

once you fetch all users and the promise is fulfilled, we can translate those into dom objects. the last callback in that promise chain should be to a function where the dom manipulation happens

maybe, one function which gets at all of the ones, one which iterates through them, etc.


Tasks:

add event listener onto the sidebar buttons. on click, display the note title and body in the main content ares
